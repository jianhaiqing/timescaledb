 * This RemoteTxn represents one remote end in a distributed txn.
 * Thus, a distributed txn is made up of a collection remote txn.
 * Each remote txn corresponds to one remote connection and there
 * is a unique remote connection per user-mapping used in the
 * distributed txn. Because of this uniqueness property,
 * the user mapping oid appears first in the object, to allow
 * it to be a hash key.
 *
 * Note: Using the user mapping OID rather than
 * the foreign server OID + user OID avoids creating multiple connections when
 * the public user mapping applies to all user OIDs.
 *
 * The "conn" pointer can be NULL if we don't currently have a live connection.
 * When we do have a connection, xact_depth tracks the current depth of
 * transactions and subtransactions open on the remote side.  We need to issue
 * commands at the same nesting depth on the remote as we're executing at
 * ourselves, so that rolling back a subtransaction will kill the right
 * queries and not the wrong ones.

 * Start remote transaction or subtransaction, if it hasn't been
 * already started (e.g. by a previous command in the same txn).
 *
 * We always use at least REPEATABLE READ in the remote session.
 * This is important even for cases where we use the a single connection to
 * a remote server. This is because a single frontend command may cause multiple
 * remote commands to be executed (e.g. a join of two tables on one remote
 * node might not be pushed down and instead two different queries are sent
 * to the remote node, one for each table in the join). Since in READ
 * COMMITED the snapshot is refreshed on each command, the semantics are off
 * when multiple commands are meant to be part of the same one.
 *
 * This isn't great but we have no alternative unless we ensure that each frontend
 * command always translates to one backend query or if we had some other way to
 * control which remote queries share a snapshot or when a snapshot is refreshed.
 *
 * NOTE: this does not guarantee any kind of snapshot isolation to different connections
 * to the same server. That only happens if we use multiple user-mapping to the same server
 * in one frontend transaction. Thus, such connections that use different users will potentially
 * see inconsistent results. To solve this problem of inconsistent results, we could export the
 * snapshot of the first connection to a remote node using pg_export_snapshot() and then use that
 * using SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT xxxx across all other connections to that node during the
 * transaction. However, given that we currently don't have snapshot isolation across different
 * nodes, we don't want to commit to the overhead of exporting snapshots at this time.
